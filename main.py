## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards
def deal_card():
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card

def calculate_score(hand):
  if sum(hand) == 21 and len(hand) == 2:
    return 0
  if 11 in hand and sum(hand) > 21:
    hand.remove(11)
    hand.append(1)
    return sum(hand)
  else:
    return sum(hand)
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.
